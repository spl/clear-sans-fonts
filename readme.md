# Clear Sans

This is an archive of the Clear Sans font family (Version 1.00).

The following text is from the [project page][project-page]:

> **The Value of the Clear Sans Project**
>
> [Adopted by Mozilla][mozilla-added] for the Firefox for Android browser, Clear Sans has been
> recognized as a versatile OpenType font for screen, print, and Web. Clear Sans
> was designed with on-screen legibility in mind. It strikes a balance between
> contemporary, professional, and stylish expression and thoroughly functional
> purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant personality at all sizes, and its
> thoughtful design becomes even more evident at the thin weight.
>
> “I was drawn to Clear Sans for its practical nature. The different weights …
> offer great options for both readability and contrast, making all sorts of
> type and numbers easy for users to digest. More and more I noticed that I
> didn’t have to squint the way I usually do with fonts that I tend to see used
> a lot for dashboards, analytics, and other user interfaces.” — [Typographica,
> Michael Surtees, March 11, 2014][typographica-review]
>
> It has minimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow proportions,
> making it ideal for UI design. Its strong, recognizable forms avoid
> distracting ambiguity, making Clear Sans comfortable for reading short UI
> labels and long passages in both screen and print.
>
> This font supports a wide range of languages using Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek
> scripts. The font family includes medium, regular, thin, and liight weights
> with upright, italic, and bold styles.
>
> Clear Sans supports these code pages:
>
> * CP1252 Latin 1
> * CP1250 Latin 2
> * CP1254 Turkish
> * CP1257 Baltic
> * CP1251 Cyrillic
> * CP1253 Greek
> * CP1258 Vietnamese
>
> **Who It’s For**
>
> Clear Sans can be freely utilized by application, browser and operating system
> developers.
>
> **Project Specifics**
>
> Clear Sans is freely available for private and commercial use and distribution
> under the [Apache 2.0 License][license]. While the font is open source, the
> design files used by Monotype are not available. Clear Sans is also distinct
> from ‘Intel Clear’, a font used exclusively by Intel for its own digital
> properties.
>
> **About Intel Involvement**
>
> Clear Sans was created and designed by Daniel Ratighan at Monotype under the
> direction of the User Experience team at Intel’s Open Source Technology
> Center.

This is an editor’s note on the aforementioned [Typographica review
article][typographica-review]:

> Since there is no design credit given on the Clear Sans website, I asked
> Monotype Type Director Dan Rhatigan for more info. He says they began with an
> unpublished design by Robin Nicholas which Rhatigan and George Ryan reworked
> for Intel.
